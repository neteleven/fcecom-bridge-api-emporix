# FirstSpirit Connect for Commerce - SAP Commerce Cloud Bridge

## Overview

### Connect for Commerce Bridge API

The bridge API serves as a REST interface which is able to fetch content, product and category information from any shop backend and to display them in reports in the FirstSpirit ContentCreator.

In order to connect the bridge API with a given shop backend a bridge is needed. It acts as a microservice between the shop backend and FirstSpirit. Further information about how to implement and use a bridge can be found in the official [documentation](https://docs.e-spirit.com/ecom/fsconnect-com/FirstSpirit_Connect_for_Commerce_Documentation_EN.html).

### SAP Commerce Cloud

This project implements the bridge API to connect FirstSpirit and the SAP Commerce Cloud e-commerce platform.
